TakePhoto.ipynb - 
~This program uses OpenCV to take a photo every 5 seconds, through a webcam, and then saves it to a directory.
~Please note: if using this program, change the count variable to what ever number your last photo was, otherwise it will overwrite itself. 
~Also please note: after interrupting the program, execute the capture.release() and cv2.destroyAllWindows() cell, otherwise you will have to restart the kernal.
